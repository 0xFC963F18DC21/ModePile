# ModePile
A set of mods for https://github.com/nullpomino/nullpomino

Requires the above to compile and run.

## Modes Available:

* _2048_ - A 2048 clone.
* _Accelerator_ - A marathon mode where playing fast is rewarded.
* _Colour Power_ - A marathon mode where clearing lines using pieces of different colours nets you different power-ups.
* _EX Reborn_ (incomplete) - A clone of Tetris-EX.
* _Firework Challenge_ - An inaccurate version of Tetris the Grand Master 3's Easy mode.
* _Gem Swap_ (incomplete) - A generic match-3 game.
* _Idiot% Mode_ - A mode inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omaDz_w4cgg) where it emulates the TGM style of play, but normal line clears are next-to-worthless but spin line clears are boosted to be better than normal.
* _Joker_ - A mode that approximates the JOKER mode from DTET.
* _Minesweeper_ - It's Minesweeper. What else is there to say?
* _Mission Mode_ - Play a marathon mode, but it asks you to clear Puyo-Puyo-styled missions.
* _Scanline_ - Inspired by Scanner mode on [Tetris for the PSP Mini](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_(PSP_Mini)) and [Tetris Pop](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_Pop).
* _Score Trial_ - An approximation of the SCORE ATTACK modes in DTET.
